			Typing raw text into the search box will search all properties of every member for matching text.
			For instance, typing: <b>"woodwork"</b> will show all members whose course list includes the text "woodwork", however it will also include anyone who has the text "woodwork" in any other property, such as their comments.
		</p>
		<p>
			Searching for a true or false keyword can be done by simply entering the full text of that keyword, any members who have a true value for that keyword (or matching text in another propery) will be shown.
			Possible keywords are as follows:
			<i>
				<div style="white-space: pre; background-color: #eeeeee">
					'district'
					'firstName'
					'lastName'
					'school'
					'email'
					'courses'
					'emailSecondary'
					'aceIt'
					'facebook'
					'facebookAlias'
					'conferences'
					'comments'
					'psa'
					'psaExpires'
					'LSA' <b>(LSA/Dist Rep/Pres)</b>
					'BCTEA' <b>(exectutive)</b>
					'retired'
					'retiredYear'
					'leave'
					'leaveYear'
					'academics'
					'maker'
					'startedTeaching'
					'lastUpdated'
				</div>
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			Should you wish to perform a search of a specific property, you may use the syntax: <i>property</i>:<b>searchterm</b>.
			For instance: <b>"facebook:false"</b>, or <b>"psaExpires:2016"</b> (dates are treated as text, where a date looks like <i>Mon Sep 28 1998 14:36:22 GMT-0700 (PDT)</i>, so you can search for dates by specifying matching text)
